# StudentActivitiesPage
Possible home area for all that is WLU student activities. 
Initial thoughts on a website.
Probably should've done a mood board before hack and slashing at some webpages. Got a really nice landing page that will probably stay.

There's so much I want on here that I'm not sure where to put anything. I feel like this would work much better than the Canvas Page for some reason.

1) Be able to reserve a table in/out of commons from website
2) Be able to request an event be advertised
3) Have all the of the relevant Canvas stuff available.
4) Have featured events on the webpage, and a way to get featured (see #2)
5) Have a page with contact info and maybe info on work studys
6) Contact page for questions that sends them to multiple people to be sorted so that the SA director only has to deal with stuff nobody else can.
